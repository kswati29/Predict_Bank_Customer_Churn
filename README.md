# Predict_Bank_Customer_Churn
Churn Classification models using Ensemble methods approach of voting, bagging boosting and stacking

## Introduction and Goal
This churn modeling notebook is associated with focused customer retention programs, i.e. predict behavior to retain customers. The data set is obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not, that is, whether the customer will leave the bank (close account) or continue to be a customer given customer details.

## Approach and Technique
This is a binary classification modeling task ans the approach demonstrated uses a bank's churning dataset to build a classifier for predicting customer churn.
An ensemble is a composite modeling that combines few low performing classifiers to create an improved classifier.
For this task, different ensemble methods are implemented and compared with respect to the performance metrics. In particular the models employed are:

1. Voting (Hard and Soft)
2. Bagging
3. Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM)
4. Stacking

The performance metrics used is accuracy.

## Result
Overall, for the data provided, Boosting technique shows highest accuracy to predict customer churn and Bagging shows the least. Stacking accuracy(0.851) is somewhat close and comparable to Boosting-LGBM results(0.852). Individually, Random Forest accuracy score is the highest overall at 0.8535.
